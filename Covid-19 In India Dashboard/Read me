🦠 Covid-19 in India – Tableau Dashboard

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the impact of Covid-19 in India by visualizing key trends such as confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths across states and time periods. Using Tableau, I created an interactive dashboard that provides a clear picture of how the pandemic evolved and affected different regions in India.

The dashboard helps policymakers, researchers, and the public understand the spread, recovery patterns, and hotspots, supporting better decision-making and resource allocation.
