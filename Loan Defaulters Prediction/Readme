📊 Loan Default Prediction & Financial Insights – Tableau Dashboard

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer financial data to identify patterns in loan disbursement, repayment behavior, and default risks. Using Tableau, I built interactive dashboards to visualize key metrics such as loan defaults by age, disbursed amounts per branch, delinquent accounts, and customer document verification trends.

The dashboards provide data-driven insights that can help financial institutions improve credit risk assessment, loan portfolio management, and branch-level performance monitoring.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze customer loan default behavior across employment types and age groups

Visualize document verification flags (Aadhar, PAN, Passport, VoterID, Driving License, etc.) for KYC compliance

Track sanctioned vs. disbursed loan amounts by branch and customer segment

Compare new vs. delinquent accounts and inquiries across branches

Assess Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios and asset costs for risk profiling

📂 Dataset

The dataset includes anonymized customer and financial data with:

Customer Demographics: Age, Employment Type (Salaried, Self-employed, Others)

Loan Details: Sanctioned Amount, Disbursed Amount, Active & Overdue Accounts

Branch-Level Insights: Loan disbursement, inquiries, and defaults by branch

KYC Documents: Flags for Aadhar, PAN, Passport, VoterID, Driving License

📊 Key Dashboards & Insights

📑 Document Verification Dashboard

Displays distribution of KYC documents submitted by customers

Highlights gaps in identity-document compliance

👥 Employment Type vs Default Rates

Shows default percentages among Salaried, Self-Employed, and Other customer groups

Offers insight on riskier customer segments

🏦 Branch-Level Loan Disbursement

Compares disbursed amounts across branches

Identifies high- and low-performing branches

📉 Delinquent Accounts vs New Accounts

Compares delinquent account counts with new customer acquisitions per branch

Helps in monitoring portfolio quality over time

💰 LTV & Asset Cost Analysis

Displays LTV ratio distribution across branches

Highlights branches with higher risk exposure

📈 Age-wise Default Analysis

Shows which age groups (e.g. 38–50) have higher default rates

Helps shape targeted credit strategies
