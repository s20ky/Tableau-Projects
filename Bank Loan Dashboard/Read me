📊 Bank Loan Default Analysis & Financial Insights – Tableau Dashboard

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing bank loan data to uncover patterns in loan approvals, disbursements, repayment behavior, and defaults. Using Tableau, I built interactive dashboards to visualize key metrics such as loan approval trends, default rates, customer profiles, and branch-level loan performance.

The dashboards provide data-driven insights to help financial institutions strengthen credit risk assessment, portfolio management, and compliance monitoring.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze loan application trends and approval vs. rejection status.

Track default rates across borrower demographics and loan types.

Visualize loan disbursement amounts across branches and customer groups.

Compare active vs. delinquent accounts for portfolio quality monitoring.

Assess risk indicators such as Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios and overdue accounts.

Provide branch-level insights for performance benchmarking.

📂 Dataset

The dataset includes anonymized loan application and repayment records with:

Customer Demographics: Age, Employment Type, Income Group

Loan Details: Application Status (Approved/Rejected), Loan Amount, Disbursement, Overdue Accounts

Branch-Level Insights: Loan disbursement, inquiries, defaults, portfolio quality

Risk Indicators: Loan-to-Value ratios, repayment trends, default percentages
